/*
 * 1. The import statement is incorrect. The module needs to be wrapped in {} and the spelling of 'from' was incorrect.
    The other issue is that in the HTML file, the <script> tag needs to have "type="module" attribute attached to it.
    The script is not executing correctly as the 'defer' attribute is missing, causing the JS to load first when the HTML needs to run first.
    Also, the <footer> tag is outside of the <body> tag... (not sure if this was intended?)
 * 2. Changes that need to happen would be wrapping the modules in {}, spelling 'from' correctly and then adding the two attributes (type="module" and defer)
    I would also fix the indentation of the <head> tag in the HTML file as well as moving the <footer> tag into the body so that it is displayed.
